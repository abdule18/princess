            <p>Wishing you all the love and happiness in the world, all of which you deserve. Since the first day I met you, life has been worth living a little more. 🥰💖 You are beautiful in so many ways that words cannot express. You have a beautiful mind🧘🏾‍♀️, a beautiful soul🥀, a beautiful heart💝, and a beautiful aura🥰. I feel like the luckiest man to have met you🌺. You have made me want to be a better man for you; you have made me want to make you the happiest woman alive. I love all the little things you do. I love your scent. I love your beautiful smile🥰, the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you hold me, the way you blush and get fluster and finally I love your voice. I wish you nothing but the best life has to offer. May Allah grant you many, many more years of life, good health, wealth, and prosperity. May Allah grant you everything you ask Him for. May Allah answer all your prayers and give you things you don't even know you need. Enjoy your special day, PRINCESS!🥳💖</p>
            <p>I LOVE YOU, MY PRETTY LITTLE PRINCESS🥳💖</p>
